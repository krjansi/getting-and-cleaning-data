+Description of variables in the obtained data sets "DataSet1" and "DataSet2"
+===========
+
+The following is a description of the variables stored in the "DataSet1" and "DataSet2", which are the result of running the "run_analysis.R" R script that cleans the "original dataset" for later data-analysis purposes. To understand the information about the data which is stored in both datasets it is advised to read the "README.txt" and "features_info.txt" documentation files of the original dataset. It is specially important to read the mentioned documentation to understand the units in which these data is represented. Which is located here:

+
+As explained in the original documentation (the following is quoted from the original data-set's documentation): "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."
+
+About the measurement units, quoting again the original data-set: "Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].".
+
+Note: the following data sets are a cleaned version of the original dataset for the purpose of further post-processing and data analysis work in R, which are not contained in this repository. Thus, little post-processing is performed by the run_analysis.R R script.
+
+### DataSet1
+
+Each row of this dataset represents a different experiment, where data was acquired while the subject was performing one of the six following activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. The variables stored are the result of post-processing the acquired data (where post-processing was done by the authors of the original data set). In DataSet1, for each experiment, only the mean and standard deviation variables have been kept.
+
+The first and second column correspond to the subject's identification number and to the activity being performed by the subject during the data acquisition. The rest of the columns correspond to the mean and standard deviation of various features of the acquired data curves. These features are the following ([column_number] feature_name, the first two colums are included for clarity):
+ [1] "subject"
+ [2] "activity"

+### DataSet2
+
+This data-set is a summary of the previous data-set "DataSet1". It is an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
+
+The first and second column correspond to the subject's identification number and to the activity being performed by the subject during the data acquisition. The rest of the columns correspond to the mean (of the means) of all similar experiments performed by the same subject executing the same activity. The columns of DataSet2 are the following ([column_number] column_name or feature_name):
+
